- Using the following video above as well as other resources to guide me through the download and use of mySQL, I have enhanced my understanding of code through individual study a great amount.
- Overall I think I',m on track to being able to understand authentication using spring security, and being able to integrate it with CRUD features.
- Some challenges I ran into were setting up mySQL and actually creating the schema / database to be utilized as illustrated in the video.
- Another problem I ran into was importing the code into a repository, which I found videos of how to do so in the local console, allowing me to showcase progress so far within the repo on the review ticket.
- I'd evaluate this week as relatively successful.
