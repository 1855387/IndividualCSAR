- Using the following video above as well as other resources to guide me through the download and use of mySQL, I have enhanced my understanding of code through individual study a great amount.
- Overall I think I',m on track to being able to understand authentication using spring security, and being able to integrate it with CRUD features
- I'd evaluate this week as relatively successful.
